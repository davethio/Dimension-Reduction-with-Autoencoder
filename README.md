# Dimension Reduction with Autoencoder

## Description
This project implements an autoencoder-based approach for dimensionality reduction. The autoencoder is trained to compress and reconstruct high-dimensional data efficiently, enabling effective feature extraction and visualization.

## Features
- Uses deep autoencoder architecture for dimensionality reduction
- Can be applied to high-dimensional datasets
- Helps in visualization and clustering tasks
- Reconstruction loss monitoring during training

## Dataset
- The dataset can be any high-dimensional numerical dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, etc.).
- Preprocessing includes normalization and reshaping for autoencoder input.
